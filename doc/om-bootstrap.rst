Om-Bootstrap
*******************

**om-bootstrap** is a package that builds on both ``om`` and ``bootstrap`` to
supply a wide variety of UI widgets. The underlying engine is ``om`` and
``ClojureScript``, but your HTML markup and the finished UI are intended to
mirror the Twitter ``bootstrap`` project.
