Om-Bootstrap
*******************

`om-bootstrap`_ is a package that builds on both `om`_ and `bootstrap`_ to
supply a wide variety of UI widgets. The underlying engine is ``om`` and
``ClojureScript``, but your HTML markup and the finished UI are intended to
mirror components found in the Twitter ``bootstrap`` project.
