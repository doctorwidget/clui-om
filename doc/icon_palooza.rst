****************
Icon Palooza
****************

This next demo repeats some aspects of the previous demonstrations: there are
tiles just like in ``Colored Tiles``, and there is a shrinking-and-growing
display of those tiles based on UI widgets, like in ``Card Tricks``. But rather
than simple colored tiles we're showing off the ``font-awesome`` icon set, and
rather than having things blink on and off we're using CSS animations, and
showing how those can be controlled via ClojureScript.
