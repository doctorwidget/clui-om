Web Audio

This page demonstrates the *Web Audio* API. There are two separate
demonstrations on this page. The first is a straight copy and paste from Fogus's
*Joy of Clojure*, showing how to instantiate notes and play collections of notes
(i.e. melodies!). The second is my own home-grown implementation of an
electronic keyboard, allowing the user to play arbitrary notes of arbitrary
durations.
