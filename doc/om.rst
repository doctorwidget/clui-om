****************
Om
****************

`Om`_ is a ClojureScript project designed to work with Facebooks' ``react.js``
library. The idea is to provide a solid foundation for building client-side UIs.
The ClojureScript community is all aflutter over this, so it's time we looked
into it.

Official Tutorials
------------------------

There are two official tutorials that are part of the *Om* github repository:
one `basic`_ and one `intermediate`_. I have worked through them without trying
to squeeze them into this project: you can find them in their pure
unadulaterated glory at ``~code/clj/demo/om-tut/`` and
``~code/clj/demo/om-async/``.

React In Om
---------------

However, this project *does* include code that shows the entire original
``React`` tutorial (which we briefly discussed on the prior page) redone in pure
``Om``.
