      This page demonstrates basic usage of the <strong>React.js</strong>
      without any use of <em>ClojureScript</em> at all, let alone <em>Om</em>
      or <em>Kioo</em>. This is implemented as straight up JavaScript,
      HTML, and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
       The tutorial also uses a few other libraries, such as <em>JQuery</em>
       and <em>Showdown</em>, but they are only to add a bit of flair. React 
       has no external dependencies out of the box. 
    <p>
      See the main 
      <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html">React tutorial</a>
      for a step-by-step walkthrough of this code. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this tutorial does <em>not</em> implement any kind of
      server-side storage whatsoever. A static JSON file is used as a
      <em>very crude</em> mock database, and it is reloaded every few seconds.
      Thus, posted comments appear right away (because of the <em>optimisitic 
      update</em> code in the tutorial), but they vanish as soon as the JSON
      file is reloaded. This would be easy to fix, but I haven't bothered, my
      goal is to move on to <code>Om</code> instead of vanilla React ASAP.
