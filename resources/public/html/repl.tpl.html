    <h1>REPL Host Page</h1>
    <div>
       <h2>It takes two to tango.</h2>
       <p>
              This page must run ClojureScript code to allow for a REPL socket connection.
              That script is loaded below. This makes this page a <em>potential</em>
              listener for ClojureScript REPL connections.
       </p>
       <p>
             Then this page must be accessible via a true web server. That happens
             via <strong>lein ring server</strong>, or your server solution of choice.
             You'll need to have this page actually loaded into browser, not just
             accessible in theory. 
       </p>
       <p>
             Finally, the separate terminal window must be launched. That's where
             <strong>austin</strong> comes in.
